# Private Solver Log (Non-Curated)

This is a non-curated list of additional problems I worked through that were not worth formal writeups. Most of these are standard exercises from intro probability, stochastic processes, or interview-style EV puzzles. I kept this mainly to track coverage and repetition, not to showcase anything.

### Variants of Problems Already in /problems
- coupon collector for n = 4,5
- biased HH / HT patterns (p != 0.5)
- gambler’s ruin with asymmetric p
- absorption time for N = 2,3 (tiny cases)
- expected draws with partial coupons revealed

### Basic Probability & Conditioning
- negative binomial small cases
- geometric waiting times (several p)
- total probability with discrete priors
- conditional coin puzzles (birthdays, boys/girls variants)
- Bayes with two and three hypotheses (simple priors)

### Linearity of Expectation & Indicators
- expected number of 6s in n dice
- expected number of matches in random
